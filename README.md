Coin + Hand Wave Based Smart Food Dispenser for Street Dogs
# üêæ Paws-o-Aid

A smart, coin + hand-wave based **food dispenser for street dogs**.  
Built using **Arduino, IR sensors, Ultrasonic sensor, Servo motor, LCD, and buzzer**.

## ‚ú® Features
- Coin detection (IR sensor)
- Hand wave activation (Ultrasonic)
- Servo-controlled food release
- LCD status messages
- Buzzer feedback + LED indicators
- Cooldown system to prevent overfeeding

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `Arduino Code/` ‚Üí Arduino code
- `Documentations/` ‚Üí Synopsis, circuit diagram, images
- `README.md` ‚Üí Project overview

## üöÄ How It Works
1. Insert a coin ‚Üí Buzzer beep + "Coin OK!"
2. Wave your hand ‚Üí Dispensing starts
3. Servo opens food container
4. LCD shows "Thank You!"
5. Cooldown time ensures fair feeding


## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributions & Future Enhancements

This project is modular and open for further improvements:

- **Solar-Powered Operation:** Implement solar panels or battery backup for outdoor, off-grid use.  
- **App-Based Control:** Enable remote monitoring, usage statistics, and refill alerts via a mobile application.  
- **Multi-Dog Feeding System:** Adapt the dispenser to serve multiple animals simultaneously.  
- **Coin Acceptor Upgrade:** Replace the IR sensor with a dedicated coin acceptor to prevent misuse.  
- **Digital Payment Integration:** Support QR-based or mobile payments for a cashless system.  
- **RFID Animal Tracking:** Equip animals with RFID tags for feeding history, tracking, and vaccination monitoring.  
- **Enhanced Dispensing Mechanism:** Upgrade to stronger motors to handle larger portions or different animal types.  
- **Automatic Refill Alerts:** Add sensors to notify caretakers when food levels are low.
